not allowed to marry, and this alliance does not generally 
take place Female orphans belong to the nearest male re- 
lative, as also does a widow, instead of to the nearest male 
relative of the husband, as was found to be the case in 
Western Australia by Captain Grey. Two or three months 
generally elapse before the widow goes to another hus-

wives for themselves, but it can only be done with the 
parents’ consent, or after their death. Ifa wife be stolen, 
war is always continued until she is given up, or another 
female in her place. 
“ There is no ceremony connected with the undertaking 
of marriage. In those cases where I have witnessed the 
giving away of a wife, the woman was simply ordered by 
the nearest male relative in whose disposal she was, to take 
up her ‘ rocko,’ the bag in which a female carries the effects 
of her husband, and go to the man’s camp to whom she had 
been given. Marriage is not looked upon as any pledge of 
chastity, indeed no such virtue is recognised. But little 
real affection consequently exists between husbands and 
wives, and young men value a wife principally for her ser- 
vices as a slave; in fact, when asked why they are anxious 
to obtain wives, their usual reply is, that they may get 
wood, water, and food for them, and carry whatever pro- 
perty they possess.” 
NATIVE MODESTY. 
“ Innate propriety of behaviour is also frequently exhi- 
bited by the Aborigines in their natural state, in the modest 
unasuming manner in which they take their positions to 
observe what is going on, and in a total absence of any- 
thing that is rude or-offensive. It is true that the reverse 
of this is also often to be met with; but I think it will 
usually be found that it is among natives who have before 
been in contact with Europeans, or where familiarities have 
been used with them first, or an injudicious system of treat- 
ment has been adopted towards them. 
“ Delicacy of feeling is not often laid to the charge of the 
Aborigines, and yet I was witness to a singular instance of 
it at King George’s Sound. I was looking one evening at 
the natives dancing, and who were, as they always are on 
these occasions, in a state of complete nudity. In the
