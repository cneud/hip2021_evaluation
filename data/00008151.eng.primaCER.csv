SuriciDE 1N A BRoTHEL.—On the afternoon of Thurs- 
day week an inquest was opened before the deputy-coroner 
for Middlesex, on,the body of a young man who committed 
suicide in a house of ill-fame, under somewhat extraordi- 
nary circumstances. A woman of the town, named Harriet 
Mayne, was the principal witness. She deposed to having 
met the deceased on the night of Tuesday, the 2nd inst., at 
aconcert atthe Garrick’s Head, in Bow street, where she 
had part of a pint of sherry with him and a friend of his, 
About three o’clock on Wednesday morning the deceased 
accompanied her to her lodgings in Aldenham street, and 
remained in bed till two o’clock on Wednesday afternoon 
when she invited him to have some breakfast, but he re- 
fused, and said he would rather have a glass of wine. He 
gave witness half-a-crown to send for a pint of sherry, 
and on her calling Margaret Bryan, the landlady’s daughter 
to go for it, deceased added, “ Stay, I will send for some- 
thing else that will do me good. Deceased then asked for 
a pen and ink, and wrote a prescription in Latin, telling 
her to send it to some chemist, giving her 2s. to procure it. 
Margaret Bryan went to the shop of Mr Wakefield, and on 
her return with the wine, said that Mr Wakefield said he 
had not got any, and that it was poison. Witness told de- 
ceased, who said, “ Nonsense, it is no such thing; it is only 
to enliven up low spirits, Send to another doctor.” Mar- 
garet Bryan then wentto the shop of Mr Rentmore, in Cla- 
rendon square, and brought back a phial about three parts 
full of stuff smelling like almonds. Deceased was then 
lying on the sofa in the parlour, and appeared very cheer- 
ful. Witness left him to get her breakfast, leaving the phial 
and the wine on the table. She returned in about five 
minutes; and, on entering the room, asked deceased how 
he was. He replied, he felt better, but his stomach began 
to pain him; at that moment he turned over on the sofa 
and appeared fainting, and made a gurgling noise in the 
throat. She called for water, and then sent for a doctor, 
Mr Wakefield came, and said he was dead, and had taken 
poison,—By the Coroner: I had never seen the deceased 
befor@ I had not the slightest idea that he had sent for 
poison, and J intended to have taken a portion of what he 
sent for had he left any, as he said it was for low spirits, 
I should say he was not more than twenty years ot age. 
When alive he appeared of rather sallow complexion, and 
has dark-brown hair. His dress consists of a black frock 
coat, black satin waistcoat, lavender-coloured striped trou- 
sers with straps, the whole quite new, a blue striped silk 
neckerchief, white stockings, yellow kid goves, and short 
boots, a new hat, maker’s name “ ‘Townend, Cheapside and 
Regent street.” He had with him a small yellow stick, 
with the handle much bitten, and his linen was marked 
“G, Oldfield, jun.” On his person were found two hand- 
kerchiefs, one white muslin, with the name “ G. Oldfield ” 
on it, the other silk; a cigar-case, a green purse studded 
with steel beads and tassle, with 2s. in it, and on his finger 
a gold ring with a green stone. Deceased did not give 
witness any other money than for the wine and for the

over a vast extent of country, and, for the purpose of a
speedy transit from one part to the other, railways have
been established, one of which is formed on an inclined
plane, down which the heavily laden waggons are propelled
at a fearful rate. On the morning of the above day, while
one of the train of waggons was passing down, two very
old women, each being nearly seventy years of age, labour-
ing under defective sight as well as hearing, got on the
line. A few seconds more they both must have inevitably
been crushed to death. Their perilous situation was, how-
ever, witnessed by Mr David Holsgrove, the overlooker of
the works, who in an instant dashed forward and seized the
two females, whom he threw oﬀ the line, and out of the
way of danger. Unfortunately the engine at this instant
came up, which knocked Mr Holsgrove down, and he was
picked up as dead. He was instantly conveyed to one of
the buildings in the vicinity, and medical aid was sent for,
when, upon examination, it was discovered that he had
sustained several contusions about the head, that both his
arms were broken in two places, and also one of his legs,
besides other injuries about the body. It is supposed that
some part of the train must have gone over the limbs.
Although so severely and dangerously injured, hopes are
entertained of his recovery. The two females escaped
without the slightest injury.
SUICIDE IN A BROTHEL.—On the afternoon of Thurs-
day week an inquest was opened before the deputy-coroner
for Middlesex, on the body of a young man who committed
suicide in a house of ill-fame, under somewhat extraordi-
nary circumstances. A woman of the town, named Harriet
Mayne, was the principal witness. She deposed to having
met the deceased on the night of Tuesday, the 2nd inst., at
a concert at the Garrick's Head, in Bow street, where she
had part of a pint of sherry with him and a friend of his.
About three o'clock on Wednesday morning the deceased
accompanied her to her lodgings in Aldenham street, and
remained in bed till two o'clock on Wednesday afternoon,
when she invited him to have some breakfast, but he re-
fused, and said he would rather have a glass of wine. He
gave witness half-a-crown to send for a pint of sherry,
and on her calling Margaret Bryan, the landlady's daughter
to go for it, deceased added, “ Stay, I will send for some-
thing else that will do me good. Deceased then asked for
a pen and ink, and wrote a prescription in Latin, telling
her to send it to some chemist, giving her 2s. to procure it.
Margaret Bryan went to the shop of Mr Wakeﬁeld, and on
her return with the wine, said that Mr Wakeﬁeld said he
had not got any, and that it was poison. Witness told de-
ceased, who said, “ Nonsense, it is no such thing ; it is only
to enliven up low spirits. Send to another doctor.” Mar
garet Bryan then went to the shop of Mr Rentmore, in Cla-
rendon square, and brought back a phial about three parts
full of stuﬀ smelling like almonds. Deceased was then
lying on the sofa in the parlour, and appeared very cheer-
ful. Witness left him to get her breakfast, leaving the phial
and the wine on the table. She returned in about ﬁve
minutes ; and, on entering the room, asked deceased how
he was. He replied, he felt better, but his stomach began
to pain him ; at that moment he turned over on the sofa
and appeared fainting, and made a gurgling noise in the
throat. She called for water, and then sent for a doctor.
Mr Wakeﬁeld came, and said he was dead, and had taken
poison.—By the Coroner : I had never seen the deceased
before. I had not the slightest idea that he had sent for
poison, and I intended to have taken a portion of what he
sent for had he left any, as he said it was for low spirits.
I should say he was not more than twenty years of age.
When alive he appeared of rather sallow complexion, and
has dark-brown hair. His dress consists of a black frock
coat, black satin waistcoat, lavender-coloured striped trou-
sers with straps, the whole quite new, a blue striped silk
neckerchief, white stockings, yellow kid goves, and short
boots, a new hat, maker's name “ Townend, Cheapside and
Regent street.” He had with him a small yellow stick,
with the handle much bitten, and his linen was marked
“ G. Oldﬁeld, jun.” On his person were found two hand-
kerchiefs, one white muslin, with the name “ G. Oldﬁeld ”
on it, the other silk ; a cigar-case, a green purse studded
with steel beads and tassle, with 2s. in it, and on his ﬁnger
a gold ring with a green stone. Deceased did not give
