ERDOE’S WATERPROOF OVER-COATS,
SHOOTING JACKETS, &c. in Llamas and other new and
greatly approved materials, manufactured expressly for W. B.—These
really waterproof garments having been in extensive use seven years, and
become established in the estimation of the respectable classes, are, it is
presumed, now too well known to need description or recommendation.
Daily experience increasingly proves that, where once adopted, they are
regarded as sine-qua-nons. A large stock of ﬁrst-rate GARMENTS,
adapted to all purposes, and guaranteed to exclude any rain whatever,
kept to select from of which an inspection is conﬁdently invited.—Made
only by W. BERDOE, TAILOR, WATERPROOFER, &c. 69 CORN-
HILL (north side).

AD DIGESTION—WONDERFUL CURE by
HOLLOWAY’S PILLS and OINTMENT.—T. Gardiner, Esq.
of 9 Brown street, Grosvenor square, declares that he had been under four
of the most eminent physicians, besides ﬁve of the greatest surgeons in
London. He suﬀered from a distended stomach, bad digestion, settled
pains in the chest, was very nervous and greatly debilitated, and scarcely
able to walk a hundred yards. Not deriving the least relief from the
Faculty, he set about rubbing large quantities of Hollyway’s Ointment
into his chest, and took Hollyway’s Pills night and morning, which eﬀec-
tually restored him to perfect health and vigour in the short space of three
weeks.—Sold at Professor Holloway’s Establishment, 244 Strand, and by
all respectable Medicine Venders.
T
HE COLD WATER CURE.—The HYDRO–
PATHIC ESTABLISHMENT, at Sudbrook park, near Rich-
mond, Surrey, is now in full operation, under the personal superin-
tendence of the eminent Joseph Weiss, M. D., from Friewaldeau, and
late of Stanstead Bury, formerly the coadjutor of Vincent Preissnitz,
at Graefenberg. The beautiful domain of Sudbrook, upwards of 100
acres, forms the western boundary of the Royal park of Richmond, to
which the patients enjoy the privilege of immediate access by a private
entrance. The plunge and other baths, with the pleasure grounds, have
undergone recent and great improvement. There is a spacious sale-a-
manger, and an excellent billiard and drawing rooms. The terms of
the establishment vary from three guineas per week and upwards (ac-
cording to the apartments), which includes medical attendance, board,
lodging, and servants. Dr Weiss may be consulted every day at Sud-
brook park, at 28 Sackville street, Piccadilly, for the convenience of parties
wishing to consult him London. Prospectuses may be had on appli
cation to Dr

munication between Manchester and Derby, and will considerably shorten
the distance between Manchester and Nottingham and Manchester and
Liecester.
The line from Derby to Rugby will establish the direct communication
from that town to London, which has been so long considered desirable
by the inhabitants.
The same will apply to Sheﬀield, when the Sheﬀield and Chesterﬁeld
branch of the North Midland Railway is made.
The great advantages of the Rugby, Derby, and Manchester Railway,
through Leek, over the other projects into Manchester, among others,
are—
First. That there are only 75 miles of railway to be made in the place
of 189.
Secondly. That it is a more direct line from London to Manchester than
even the proposed direct lines.
Thirdly. That it interferes with no existing railway property or vested
interests.
Fifthly. That it passes through the towns in its route, in place of
avoiding them.
Fourthly. That it passes through a district rich in manufactures, agri-
culture, and minerals, but which—more especially as regards its agricul-
tural produce, and a convenient system of intercommunication for the
conveyance of that agricultural produce, to supply the large manufac-
turing towns in the vicinity—has been hitherto left totally without rail-
way communication.
Sixthly. That the whole line of railway from Rugby to Manchester
will be completed and in working order within ten months from the pass-
ing of the Act of Parliament.
Seventhly. That the maps, plans, estimates, and other documents re-
quired by the standing orders of Parliament will be lodged with the parish
clerks, the clerks of the peace for the counties, and the parliamentary
oﬀices, on the 10th day of November next, being twenty days within the
time required by the regulations of Parliament.
The report of the engineer of the Company is already completed, and
will be made public in a few days, upon which a further and full pro-
spectus with the names of the Provisional Directory, will be published.
