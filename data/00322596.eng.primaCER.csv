Impressep with feelings of gratitude and respect, the 
Proprietor of Tue Hur. Packer anp Humper Mercury 
returns his sincere acknowledgments to his Friends and the 
Public, for the liberal support afforded to the undertaking in 
which he has engaged. In connecting himself with this 
concern, as a fair and honourable speculation, he was in- 
fluenced chiefly by the persuasion, that a Journal so long 
established, and at one period possessing so large a share of 
public favour, could not fail, if conducted with spirit, to 
rise in general estimation, and to attain ultimately such 
respectability in circulation and commercial patronage as 
would amply repay his exertions. In pursuance of this 
improvements were introduced into the 
typographical department of Tne Packer; the size of the 
sheet was considerably enlarged, and other arrangements 
were adopted, by which not only the amount of miscellaneous 
reading contained in the old paper was nearly doubled, but a 
greater quantity and variety of matter presented to the 
reader, in this publication, than in either of the other papers 
printed in Hull. The event has proved that the efforts of 
the Proprietor to raise this publication to eminence, as a most 
useful and interesting Provincial Journal, have been fully 
appreciated by a liberal and discerning Pubtic. The result 
has already exceeded his most sanguine anticipations: not 
only has the circulation of Tue Packer obtained, in the space 
of two months, an increase of subscribers unprecedented in 
so short a period, but the numerous favours of the mercantile 
and other classes, which appear in its columns weekly, prove 
it to be already firmly established as an eligible vehicle for 
Advertisements, and Notices of every description.—In return 
for the extensive support he has received, the Proprietor, in 
acknowledging the heartfelt obligations he is under to his 
numerous Friends and the Public generally, takes this 
opportunity to express his intention to spare no pains or 
expense to sustain the credit already acquired by THe Hutt 
Packer AND Humper Mercury, and to meet with spirit, 
and with alacrity, competition of every description. In 
accordance with this determination, he respectfully an-

COLUMNS, in width; the twenty-four columns of which the 
paper will then consist, to be of such additional length, as 
may appear consistent with symmetry and fair proportion. 
A compensation will thus be given to the general reader, for 
the space occupied by the Advertisements and Notices so 
liberally contributed to THE Packer, through the kindness of 
its commercial friends, and for the room unavoidably taken 
up by the Markets, Shipping Intelligence, and other articles, 
valuable to men of business, but conducing little to the 
interest and attractions of a Newspaper. So very important 
an increase of space will enable the conductors of this paper 
to devote more attention to many subjects of a popular 
character, that have been necessarily curtailed in their limits 
in preceding publications, and to impart in other respects 
an improved feature to this Journal. The Parliamentary 
proceedings of the ensuing Session, under the present cir- 
cumstances of the country, will possess a paramount claim 
upon the attention of all classes of the community. By the 
increased size of this paper, its conductors will be enabled to 
present the reader with a faithful transcript of the most 
important Debates, without abridging the local, mercantile, 
agrieultural, and other intelligence, mteresting to the readers 
of a Provincial Journal. The period during which this pub- 
lication has been condueted by the parties at present engaged 
in it has been so short, that it would be presumptuous to 
allude particularly to their past labours. It will merely be 
remarked, that the tone of eandour and impartiality hitherto 
distinguishing its pages, will continue to be maintained ; and 
that every exertion will be made to render its contents 
useful, varied, and entertaining.—In conclusion, we beg our 
numerous Friends to'accept from’ us*the compliments of the 
season, which we hope it will be our fortune to pay to them 
for many succeeding years, assuring them, that our congratu- 
lations flow from hearts grateful for their kind and liberal

HESE Drops have been long esteemed for their superior eﬃcacy
in Coughs, Colds, Asthmas, and Consumptions ; they are the
invention of an Apothecary of con iderable practice, who stakes
his reputation on their salutary properties ; the extension of their sale,
and the invariable success which accompanies their application,
proves that they are a Remedy to be depended upon, on the ﬁrst
attack of Cold, and in the most obstinate Cough and Asthma. In a
suit commenced in Chancery and lately decided, Messrs. Shaw and
Edwards proved their absolute Right and Title to this valuable
Medicine. Mr. Edwards, now the sole Proprietor, informs the Public
that the above Drops are faithfully prepared by him from the original
Recipe as sworn to by Mr. ROBBERDS, the Inventor, and in his pos‑
session ; and that every bottle of the genuine preparation will have
engraved on the stamp, “ Evan Edwards, 67, St. Paul's.” Sold in
bottles, 2s. 9d. and 4s. 6d. each, and may be procured of Messrs.
T. Topping, Allanson, Ross and Burton, Hull ; Turner, and Ramsden,
Beverley ; and all Medicine Venders.
IMPRESSED with feelings of gratitude and respect, the
Proprietor of THE HULL PACKET AND HUMBER MERCURY
returns his sincere acknowledgments to his Friends and the
Public, for the liberal support aﬀorded to the undertaking in
which he has engaged. In connecting himself with this
concern, as a fair and honourable speculation, he was in‑
ﬂuenced chieﬂy by the persuasion, that a Journal so long
established, and at one period possessing so large a share of
public favour, could not fail, if conducted with spirit, to
rise in general estimation, and to attain ultimately such
respectability in circulation and commercial patronage as
would amply repay his exertions. In pursuance of this
object, various improvements were introduced into the
typographical department of THE PACKET ; the size of the
sheet was considerably enlarged, and other arrangements
were adopted, by which not only the amount of miscellaneous
reading contained in the old paper was nearly doubled, but a
greater quantity and variety of matter presented to the
reader, in this publication, than in either of the other papers
printed in Hull. The event has proved that the eﬀorts of
the Proprietor to raise this publication to eminence , as a most
useful and interesting Provincial Journal, have been fully
appreciated by a liberal and discerning Public. The result
has already exceeded his most sanguine anticipations : not
only has the circulation of THE PACKET obtained, in the space
of two months, an increase of subscribers unprecedented in
so short a period, but the numerous favours of the mercantile
and other classes, which appear in its columns weekly , prove
it to be already ﬁrmly established as an eligible vehicle for
Advertisements, and Notices of every description.—In return
for the extensive support he has received, the Proprietor, in
acknowledging the heartfelt obligations he is under to his
numerous Friends and the Public generally, takes this
opportunity to express his intention to spare no pains or
expense to sustain the credit already acquired by THE HULL
PACKET AND HUMBER MERCURY, and to meet with spirit,
and with alacrity, competition of every description. In
accordance with this determination, he respectfully an‑
nounces, that arrangements are now in progress for increasing
the size of this Journal by the ADDITION of FOUR FULL
COLUMNS, in width ; the twenty‐four columns of which the
paper will then consist, to be of such additional length, as
may appear consistent with symmetry and fair proportion.
A compensation will thus be given to the general reader, for
the space occupied by the Advertisements and Notices so
liberally contributed to THE PACKET, through the kindness of
its commercial friends, and for the room unavoidably taken
up by the Markets, Shipping Intelligence, and other articles,
valuable to men of business, but conducing little to the
interest and attractions of a Newspaper. So very important
an increase of space will enable the conductors of this paper
to devote more attention to many subjects of a popular
character, that have been necessarily curtailed in their limits
in preceding publications, and to impart in other respects
an improved feature to this Journal. The Parliamentary
proceedings of the ensuing Session, under the present cir‑
cumstances of the country, will possess a paramount claim
upon the attention of all classes of the community. By the
increased size of this paper, its conductors will be enabled to
present the reader with a faithful transcript of the most
important Debates, without abridging the local, mercantile,
agrieultural, and other intelligence, interesting to the readers
of a Provincial Journal. The period during which this pub‑
lication has been conducted by the parties at present engaged
in it has been so short, that it would be presumptuous to
allude particularly to their past labours. It will merely be
remarked, that the tone of eandour and impartiality hitherto
distinguishing its pages, will continue to be maintained ; and
that every exertion will be made to render its contents
useful, varied, and entertaining.—In conclusion, we beg our
numerous Friends to accept from us the compliments of the
season , which we hope it will be our fortune to pay to them
for many succeeding years, assuring them, that our congratu‑
lations ﬂow from hearts grateful for their kind and liberal
support.
MISERIES OF A CHANCERY SUIT.—A very respectable man,
whose name we are not disposed to mention, was brought into
one of the watch‐houses at Dublin, lately , in a state of
extreme exhaustion and wretchedness, and having lingered
for a short time, he breathed his last. From some memo‑
randums found in his pocket, his name was ascertained, and
it was discovered, on inquiry, that his family was most
respectable, and that a property which he claimed as a right,
was in controversy for some years in the Court of Chancery.
An application was after wards made in the proper quarter by
his sister, who presented a miserable picture of penury and
distress, for means to bury him, and the receiver in the cause
was directed to dedicate a sum of ten pounds to that purpose.
He, however, not being in funds from the estate, declined
paying the sum required, but humanely advanced ﬁve pounds
for the expenses of his interment. The matter would, in all
probability , have remained a secret, were it not that a charge
was brought by the sister, who asserted that a portion of this
money had been converted by the watchmen to their own
use, in consequence of which an investigation took place, and
the parties were completely exculpated. The misery of this
poor creature's appearance deﬁes description, yet, notwith‑
standing, in her mode of expression she evinced education and
gentility . The suit to which we allude has been carrying on
for some years, in the course of which period one of the parties
(as we have stated) expired through mere want, in a common
watch‐house, and the wretched survivor remains an inmate
of our city, without a meal to sustain, or a roof to shelter her.
AWFUL EXPLOSION OF GAS.—Between eight and nine
o'clock on Tuesday evening , the neighbourhood of Hatton‑
wall, London, was thrown into the utmost confusion and
terror by a loud and terriﬁc explosion, which forced the glass
from the windows, and created the most serious fears in the
minds of the inhabitants. In a few seconds it was ascertained
that the report proceeded from the interior of the Prince of
Orange wine‐vaults, which in an instant was enveloped in
utter darkness, and ﬁlled with a dense smoke. As soon as
lights could be procured, the interior of the bar presented a
seene of indescribable confusion, Mrs. Deighton, the landlady ,
being in a state of insensibility from the force of the shock ,
the windows and blinds shivered in splinters, the ﬂooring
raised several inches, and covered with fragments of broken
decanters, bottles, and glasses. At this moment a young man
rushed up stairs from the cellar, in a state of partial suﬀoca‑
tion, and begged some person would hasten to the assistance
of the landlord; of whose fate he was quite ignorant. Two
or three individuals cautiously descended, and after some
search found Mr. Deighton extended on the ground, which
had been forced up around him, apparently lifeless. He was
instantly taken up stairs, and medical assistance procured,
and in a few seconds symptoms of returning animation be‑
came visible, he having fortunately received only a contusion
in the forehead and a lacerated nose. His account of this
extraordinary transaction is, that having some business in the
ale cellar, he went down, accompanied by a friend ( the person
who gave the alarm ), and was examining an ale cask, when
suddenly he felt the ground shake beneath his feet, and in an
instant he was thrown across the cellar, and with the violence
of the shock became deprived of all sense. His companion
was twice knocked down in endeavouring to escape by the
stairs, and has completely lost his hearing on one side. A
person who was at the bar at the moment, received so severe
a shock, that he still lies dangerously ill ; three clocks in the
house were also instantly stopped by the violence of the
concussion ; and a ﬁre grate at some distance was forced from
its setting. On examining the cellar, the ground was ascer‑
tained to have been forced up several feet, full butts were
forced from their stations, a portion of the wall thrown down,
and a most fœtid vapour pervaded the whole cellar ; but no
immediate reason could be assigned for the accident, which
was fortunately attended with no fatal consequences. The
premises were on Monday inspected by the superintendent
of the City Gas Works in Dorset‐street, Salisbury‐square,
and in his opinion the accident could not have been caused
by the gas; of which there was no appearance of escape, and
which acted as usual on being re‐lighted. On the other hand,
the cellar was in constant use, therefore no reason can exist
for supposing it to have arisen from the evaporation of pent
up vapours. A lighted candle had also been in the cellar
nearly the whole of the afternoon. The shock was felt at a

Miseries OF A CHANCERY Surr.—A very respectable man, 
whose name we are not disposed to mention, was brought into 
one of the watch-houses at Dublin, lately, in a state of 
extreme exhaustion and wretchedness, and having lingered 
for a short time, he breathed his last. From some memo- 
randuins found in his pocket, his name was ascertained, and 
it was discovered, on inquiry, that his family was most 
resptctable, and that a property which he claimed as a right, 
was in controversy for some years in the Court of Chancery. 
An application was afterwards made in the proper quarter by 
his sister, who presented a miserable picture of penury and 
distress, for means to bury him, and the receiver in the cause 
was directed to dedicate a sum of ten pounds to that purpose. 
He, however, not being in funds from the estate, declined 
paying the sum required, but humanely advanced five pounds 
for the expenses of his interment. The matter would, in all 
probability, have remained a secret, were it not that a charge 
was brought by the sister, who asserted that a portion of this 
money had been converted by the watchmen to their own 
use, in consequence of which an investigation took place, and 
the parties were completely exculpated. The misery of this 
poor creature’s appearance defies description, yet, notwith- 
standing, in her mode of expression she evinced education and 
gentility. The suit to which we allude has been carrying on 
for some years, in the course of which period one of the parties 
(as we have stated) expired through mere want, in a common 
watch-house, and the wretched survivor remains an inmate 
of our city, without a meal to sustain, or a roof to shelter her. 
Awru. Exrtosion oF GaAs.—Between eight and nine 
o’clock on Tuesday evening, the neighbourhood of Hatton- 
wall, London, was thrown into the utmost confusion and 
terror by a loud and terrific explosion, which forced the glass 
from the windows, and created the most serious fears in the 
minds of the inhabitants. In a few seconds it was ascertained 
that the report proceeded from the interior of the Prince of 
Orange wine-vaults, which in an instant was enveloped in 
utter darkness, and filled with a dense smoke. As soon as 
lights could be procured, the interior of the bar presented a 
seene of indescribable confusion, Mrs. Deighton, the landlady, 
being im a state of insensibility from the force of the shock, 
the windows and blinds shivered in splinters, the flooring 
raised several inches, and covered with fragments of broken 
decanters, bottles, and glasses, Atthismomenta young man 
rushed up stairs from the cellar, in a state of partial suffoca- 
tion, and begged some person would hasten to the assistance 
of the landlord; of whose fate he was quite ignorant. Two 
or three individuals cautiously descended, and after some 
search found Mr. Deighton extended on the ground, which 
had been forced up around him, apparently lifeless. He was 
instantly taken up stairs, and medical assistance procured, 
and in a few seconds symptoms of returning animation be- 
came visible, he having fortunately received only a contusion 
in the forehead and a lacerated nose. His account of this 
extraordinary transaction is, that having some business in the 
ale cellar, he went down, accompanied by a friend (the person 
who gave the alarm), and was examining an ale cask, when 
suddenly he felt the ground shake beneath his feet, and in an 
instant he was thrown across the cellar, and with the violence 
of the shock became deprived of all sense.. His companion 
was twice knocked down in endeavouring to escape by the 
stairs, and has completely lost his hearing on one side. A 
person who was at the bar at the moment, received so severe 
a shock, that’he still lies dangerously ill; three clocks in the 
house were also instantly stopped by the violence of the 
concussion ; and a fire grate at some distance was forced from 
its setting. On examining the cellar, the ground was ascer- 
tained to have been forced up several feet, full butts were 
forced from their stations, a portion of the wall thrown down, 
and a most foetid vapour pervaded the whole cellar; but no 
immediate reason coutd be assigned for the accident, which 
was fortunately attended with no fatal consequences. The 
premises were on Monday inspected by the superintendent 
of the City Gas Works in Dorset-street, Salisbury-square, 
and in his opinion the accident could not have been ‘caused 
by the gas, of which there was no appearance of escape, and 
which acted as usual on being re-lighted. On the other hand, 
the cellar was in coustant use, therefore no reason can exist 
for supposing it to have arisen from the evaporation of pent 
up vapours. A lighted candle had also been in the cellar 
nearly the whole of the aftcrnoon. The shock was felt at a
