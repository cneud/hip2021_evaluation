The supposition “ of 200 coalheavers, in their begrimed
clothes, forcing themselves into the grounds where a fête
was given,” does not raise the example the Norfolk Farmer
seems to desire ; for a body of men so misconducting them‑
selves would be guilty of a riot, and at once be within the
grasp of the policeman and the law.
In this letter it is stated “ that the people argue thus :
game wanders about so much that it is impossible to know
who bred the game, and therefore who is the rightful owner
of it. I may be put into prison by Squire A for taking a
hare which did not belong to him, although on his land at
the time, as it was born and bred on the land of Squire B.”
Now, of all shallow illustrations that a writer ever put forth,
this is the worst ; for the law having decided that the game
is the property of the owner on whose land it is at the mo‑
ment found, at all events the people thus made to argue,
by the Norfolk Farmer, must know that at least the game is
not theirs, and whichever way they get to gaol, they are
rightly punished for stealing that about which there is no
mistake, and as to which they have no sort of legal right or
claim. The property in a sheep does not depend upon
“ who bred it ;” and when this writer further urges “ that
the people say, if game is property, why don't you take more
care of your property, and not, by leaving it about, put
temptation in a poor man's way ? ” he seems, singularly
enough, to forget that large ﬂocks of sheep are necessarily
“ left about ” at times as much as game, and that the laws
for the protection of sheep are inﬁnitely more severe than
those for the care of game, and that it most assuredly is the
spirit of all law to be more jealously severe in its provisions
for the protection of property, precisely as, from the nature
of that property, it is of necessity liable to be left in wild and
easily accessible places. By this the charge of too great
severity in the Game Laws is at once satisfactorily an‑
swered.
Your correspondent publishes “ the arguments ” he says
“ are used on one side, without debating whether they are
correct or not,” and recommends a vast change in the law,
founded on those arguments and on a clamour which he
admits may be fallacious. Such counsel savours but little
of education or reason.
The making game private property, and legalizing its
sale, was a very great error. The manifest inattention to
the provisions for regulating its sale was a greater error ;
and last of all, the establishment of a private property, and
then not putting that private property on the same footing
with all other private property, by surrendering it into a
similar custody of police, was a crowning folly, which may
well be regarded as the patent of much of the clamour now
existing. Game is the only property not placed within the
custody of the constable. Take the constable's care from
any other species of property, and the inroads upon it would
far outstrip the theft on game. The watch, the handker‑
chief, the purse, the pocket‐book, the sheep, the fowl, the
fagot, and the potatoe, unprotected by the police, would
send to our gaols and prisons criminals, far outnumbering
those sent there by the game, in spite of the alleged incli‑
nation in the heart of man to prey upon fur and feather.
“ The Norfolk Farmer” is an excellent aid against the
army he himself desires to befriend in the ﬁeld, and he at
once points the danger of breaking in the ice. One step,
and then another—the last the nearest to destruction.
First, the right of the landlord to the wild animal is assailed,
and then the right to plant his tree. “ The mischief is, that
you cannot have pheasants without covers.” You cannot
have an English ship without the English oak. If you
give up the tree you resign the vessel ; if you yield the
claim to the game you infringe the private rights of landed
property, and you permit the restless man of change and
innovation—the man that recommends an unwholesome
concession to crime—to put in a wedge to split the wall as
well of the poor man's cottage as of the rich man's palace ;
in fact, you permit him to assault the vaunted blessings of
“ the Englishman's Castle.”
GRANTLEY F. BERKELEY.
I remain, your most obedient,
Sir,—Were it the case now as it was in the olden time,
that learning was conﬁned to “ Clerks” almost exclusively,
there would appear to be some reason for looking upon
“ the Universities” as nursery gardens in particular for
“ the Church ;” but since the general diﬀusion of know‑
ledge amongst all classes, such a reason no longer holds
good. But is not my present object to enter upon the
question of the Universities at large, but simply to regard
them as places for the especial training of the Clergy.
I should be sorry to set down aught in malice of the
Universities, or any other assemblages of my fellow‐men ;
but really it is too much when we are generally told, as we
sometimes are in Parliament when the privileges, or, as
some would call them, the abuses of the Universities ar
brought into question—that they are the nursing places of
the Church, and therefore “ procul este profani !” The an‑
swer is farcical. It is my happiness to have known many
estimable men at the Universities, and everybody knows
that men of the very highest attainments have taken their de‑
grees there ; but what has this to do with their being eﬀec‑
tive places for training the Clergy ? Why, I only state what
everybody is aware of who has had any experience at the
Universities, that those men who came up to College in my
time, with a view to orders, owed their ﬁtness for them,
not in consequence of, but in spite of, the system they found
there ; that the good remained good ; and that the unﬁt,
instead of being made better (as under a proper discipline
they might have been, or else been prevented from pro‑
ceeding further), were only made “ ten times more the
children of hell than they were before.” Their University
career was looked upon by them as a time for making play
whilst they could, knowing that soon they would be obliged
to pull in for the rest of their lives ; on the principle, with
some modiﬁcation, of “ Let us eat and drink, for to‐morrow
we die ;”—let us take our swing now, for in a few years we
must be dead to it all ! Now, shocking as it is, I declare
that I have myself heard something of the kind pleaded as
an excuse for temporary indulgence at the Universities by
one who is now moreover a most active clergyman ! And
the system tacitly permits such to take their swing ; and,
consequently, has ruined many a man altogether, in ex‑
ternal circumstances as well as in soul. That colleges, ori‑
ginally founded for “ poor scholars,” should be so defective
in discipline as to produce such enormous evils, is a na‑

Tn this letter it is stated “that the people argue thus: 
game wanders about so much that it is impossible to know 
who bred the game, and therefore who is the rightful owner

hare which did not belong to him, although on his land at

Now, of all shallowillustrations thata writer ever put forth, 
this is the worst; for the law having decided that the game 
is the property of the owner on whose land it is at the mo-

not theirs, and whichever way they get to gaol, they are 
rightly punished for stealing that about which there is no 
mistake, and as to which they have no sort of legal right or

enough, to forget that large flocks of sheep are necessarily 
“left about” at times as much as game, and that the laws 
for the protection of sheep are infinitely more severe than 
those for the care of game, and that it most assuredly is the 
spirit of all law to be more jealously severe in its provisions 
for the protection of property, precisely as, from the nature 
of that property, itis of necessity liable to be left in wild and 
easily accessible places. By this the charge of too great 
severity in the Game Laws is at once satisfactorily an- 
swered. 
Your correspondent publishes “the arguments” he says 
“are used on one side, without debating whether they are 
correct or not,” and recommends a vast change in the law, 
founded on those arguments and on a clamour which he 
admits may be fallacious. Such counsel savours but little 
of education or reason. : 
The making game private property, and legalizing its 
sale, was a very great error. The manifest inattention to 
the provisions for regulating its sale was a greater error ; 
and last of al), the establishment of a private property, and 
then not putting that private property on the same footing 
with all other private property, by surrendering it into a 
similar custody of police, was a crowning folly, which may 
well be regarded as the parent of much of the clamour now 
existing, Game is the only property not placed within the 
custody of the constable. ‘T'ake the constable’s care from 
any other species of property, and the inroads upon it would 
far outstrip the theft on game. The watch, the handker- 
chief, the purse, the pocket-book, the sheep, the fowl, the 
fagot, and the potatoe, unprotected by the police, would 
send to our gaols and prisons criminals, far outnumbering 
those sent there by the game, in spite of the alleged incli- 
nation in the heart of man to prey upon fur and feather. 
“ The Norfolk Farmer” is an excellent aid against the 
army he himself desires to befriend in the field, and he at 
once points the danger of breaking in the ice. One step, 
and then another—the last the nearest to destruction. 
First, the right of the landlord to the wild animal is assailed, 
and then the right to plant hts tree. “ The mischief is, that 
you cannot have pheasants without covers.” You cannot 
ave an English ship without the English oak. If you 
give up the tree you resign the vessel ; if you yield the 
claim to the game you infringe the private rights of landed 
property, and you permit the restless man of change and 
Inovation—the man that recommends an unwholesome 
concession to crime—to put in a wedge to split the wall as 
well of the poor man’s cettage as of the rich man’s palace ; 
in fact, you permit him to assault the vaunted blessings of 
“the Englishman’s Castle.”
