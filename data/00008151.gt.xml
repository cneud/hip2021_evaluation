	<Unicode>as to whether Carpenter had any eﬀects, the police oﬃcer
said he would not give 5s. for all he had in the house ; he had
no bed, the family laid on some straw, and that there was a
bit of a table in the house. The clerk said a distress warrant
must issue, as Carpenter was not present, and if he had not
goods to realize the amount, then the oﬃcer would return
the warrant as such, and his (Carpenter's) commitment
would then be issued. We were informed that Carpenter

	<Unicode>THE MURDER OF ELIZA GRIMWOOD.—George Hill, a
private of the 67th Regiment, now in Dublin, was brought
up for examination relative to the confession which he
had made that he was the murderer of Eliza Grimwood.—
Inspector Field, of the London police, who had been sent
over to Dublin to take charge of the prisoner, stated that
he was present at the College-street police court on Monday,
the 1st inst., when the prisoner was taken before Mr. Tyndal,
the magistrate, and on that occasion a document was read
in his presence to the eﬀect that he was the man who mur-
dered Eliza Grimwood.—Mr Traill asked the prisoner if
he still adhered to the truth of that statement. The pri-
soner replied that the confession was made when he was
under the inﬂuence of liquor, being heartily sick and tired
of the army, thinking it was the only and best mode to
obtain his dismissal. He was now willing to tell the whole
truth, and retracted the words he used as to being a mur-
derer. His object in making the self-accusation arose from
his abhorrence to the life of a soldier, and not long before
he had suﬀered six months' imprisonment for an act which
he committed in the expectation of getting out of the
army.—Inspector Field said that he had ascertained the
prisoner was tried in Dublin for stealing a watch, and con-
victed of the oﬀence, and sentenced to six months' impri-
sonment. That the prisoner bore a very indiﬀerent cha-
racter in the regiment, although he was considered a young
man of superior attainments, and spoke the French and
Italian languages ﬂuently, and that Colonel Bunbury, the
commanding oﬃcer, had given him every encouragement,
and promoted him to the rank of corporal before he had
been long in the regiment, but that owing to his misconduct
he was again reduced to the ranks.—Mr Traill said that he
should remand the prisoner until Inspector Field had made
a searching inquiry into his (prisoner's) habits, where he
had been living at the time of the murder of Eliza Grim-
wood, and other requisite information, in order that the
real truth might be ascertained.—The prisoner was then
removed from the bar, and will be brought up again this
day.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE.—An Italian, named Alex.
Corradini, was brought up at Bow street on Thursday,
charged with attempting to assassinate Mr Thomas Smith,
landlord of the Hope public house, in Blackmore street,
Clare market, under the following singular circumstances.
The prisoner had for some time frequented the house of
the complainant, and had occasionally been treated as a
friend, but abused the conﬁdence reposed in him by not
only paying much attention to his wife in his absence, but
also attempting to seduce her from her home. The com-
plainant had occasion to absent himself from town for the
purpose of superintending the funeral of an aged parent for
a few days, and on his return to town he found, from inform-
ation he had obtained from his domestics, that his wile,
who had been infatuated with the prisoner, had packed
up every available article on the premises to accompany
her paramour to Germany. He had represented himself
as a baron, and that she should become a lady of title, and
on her arrival on the continent she should have the command
of extensive domains. Some misgivings were entertained
by the domestics in the absence of the complainant of his
wife's proceedings, and the plot of her intending to abscond
with the prisoner being discovered by them, they used
their inﬂuence to prevent her taking such a rash step.
In the meantime the complainant returned, and on Mon-
day last, at a late hour of the night, the prisoner entered
ostensibly for the purpose of calling for a glass of ale ;
but as the complainant passed from one parlour to another,
the prisoner having without any reason rushed into the
parlour, drew a dagger from his sleeve, and attempted to
stab the complainant in the neck, in which he fortunately
did not succeed, and instantly made his escape from the
house, leaving the complainant in the greatest state of
alarm. Several witnesses conﬁrmed this statement by
evidence. As the defendant would not, or could not, un-
derstand English, the evidence was translated to him. He
also conversed with the magistrate in German, declaring
that he had no knife about him, and that the complainant
struck him ﬁrst with the poker from feelings of jealousy.
He displayed considerable warmth in the dock at times,
and, looking furiously at Mr Smith, muttered something
that was not clearly understood. Failing to produce the
required bail for his appearance at the sessions, Mr Jardine
committed him to prison.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

shortly before the commencement of the second part, after

accident consisted in the giving way of the planks or
rafters supporting a dressing room, in which a great num-

ment. The weight being greater than the beams could
support, they gave way, and ﬁfty or sixty persons were at
once precipitated to the stage, a fall of about twelve feet.

been attended with so little serious injury. Only one per-

	<Unicode>ANOTHER COLLIERY EXPLOSION.—On the night of the
2nd inst. the inhabitants of the village of Aberdare, who
have hardly had suﬃcient time to recover from the excite-

into a state of great consternation by an explosion in Blaen-
gawr colliery, the property of Mr Davies, of Hirwain. The
violent concussion of air consequent upon the explosion had
the eﬀect of an earthquake in shaking the whole district.
The accident was occasioned in consequence of some of the
workmen having, contrary to the positive instructions of
the master, got an underground door placed in some por-
tion of the colliery, which had the eﬀect of obstructing a
current of air. There were happily not more than ﬁve men
in the pit at the time of the explosion, three of whom were
dreadfully scorched ; they are, however, likely to recover.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>ACCIDENT ON THE MIDLAND RAILWAY.—An accident
happened on the Midland Railway on Friday last, within
six miles of Nottingham. At the Long Eaton station there
is a slight curve, which prevents a person seeing any great
distance either up or down the line, and at the time of the
train, which left Derby at ten minutes past nine a.m.,
nearing the station at Eaton, two horses, drawing an
empty cart, happened to be crossing the line from an occu-
pation road ; unfortunately the boy having care of the
horses could not see the train till it was close upon him, nor
could the engineer see the horses, consequently the engine
dashed suddenly upon the two horses, forcing the leader
into the air as high as the engine chimney, and carrying the
other along the line, the gearing being caught by a buﬀer,
for thirty or forty yards, till the engine was stopped. Both
animals were killed upon the spot, but happily the passen-
gers escaped unhurt, and were not aware of any accident
having occurred till the train had ceased running. The
lad, aged fourteen, on seeing the danger he was in, instantly
ran to the hedge-side, and fell into a ditch, and thus pre-
served himself from injury.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>ACCIDENT ON THE EDINBURGH AND GLASGOW RAIL-
WAY.—An accident took place on this line on Thursday the
4th inst., which was attended with the death of George
Macklin, one of the guards. It appears that Macklin has
been employed on the line for only four months, and in
accordance with a custom which provides that all new
guards be appointed to the charge of luggage trains as an
iniatory step, he had charge of a train of this kind which
left Glasgow at eleven o'clock on Wednesday night. The
train reached Linlithgow in safety, where one of the trucks
was to be left, and for the sake of convenience it was the
last in the train. It was in connexion with this particular
truck that Macklin lost his life, but as no person saw the
accident, the particulars of it cannot be given with certainty.
From the position, however, in which the body was found,
it is supposed to have occurred as follows :—Before the
train had been fully stopped he had swung himself on the
buﬀers of the second last truck in order to save himself the
trouble of running forward and uncoupling the last one at
the proper time ; and while in this situation he had fallen
down on the rail, and immediately the remaining truck
passed over his body. The unfortunate man was quite
unable to speak, and died in about a quarter of an hour
afterwards.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>HEROIC CONDUCT ON A RAILWAY.—On Thursday week
one of the most providential escapes, as regards human
life, occurred on the railway connected with the Bishop-
wearmouth iron works. The iron works in question extend
over a vast extent of country, and, for the purpose of a
speedy transit from one part to the other, railways have
been established, one of which is formed on an inclined
plane, down which the heavily laden waggons are propelled
at a fearful rate. On the morning of the above day, while
one of the train of waggons was passing down, two very
old women, each being nearly seventy years of age, labour-
ing under defective sight as well as hearing, got on the
line. A few seconds more they both must have inevitably
been crushed to death. Their perilous situation was, how-
ever, witnessed by Mr David Holsgrove, the overlooker of
the works, who in an instant dashed forward and seized the
two females, whom he threw oﬀ the line, and out of the
way of danger. Unfortunately the engine at this instant
came up, which knocked Mr Holsgrove down, and he was
picked up as dead. He was instantly conveyed to one of
the buildings in the vicinity, and medical aid was sent for,
when, upon examination, it was discovered that he had
sustained several contusions about the head, that both his
arms were broken in two places, and also one of his legs,
besides other injuries about the body. It is supposed that</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>

	<Unicode>SUICIDE IN A BROTHEL.—On the afternoon of Thurs-
day week an inquest was opened before the deputy-coroner
for Middlesex, on the body of a young man who committed
suicide in a house of ill-fame, under somewhat extraordi-
nary circumstances. A woman of the town, named Harriet
Mayne, was the principal witness. She deposed to having
met the deceased on the night of Tuesday, the 2nd inst., at
a concert at the Garrick's Head, in Bow street, where she
had part of a pint of sherry with him and a friend of his.
About three o'clock on Wednesday morning the deceased
accompanied her to her lodgings in Aldenham street, and
remained in bed till two o'clock on Wednesday afternoon,
when she invited him to have some breakfast, but he re-
fused, and said he would rather have a glass of wine. He
gave witness half-a-crown to send for a pint of sherry,
and on her calling Margaret Bryan, the landlady's daughter
to go for it, deceased added, “ Stay, I will send for some-
thing else that will do me good. Deceased then asked for
a pen and ink, and wrote a prescription in Latin, telling
her to send it to some chemist, giving her 2s. to procure it.
Margaret Bryan went to the shop of Mr Wakeﬁeld, and on
her return with the wine, said that Mr Wakeﬁeld said he
had not got any, and that it was poison. Witness told de-
ceased, who said, “ Nonsense, it is no such thing ; it is only
to enliven up low spirits. Send to another doctor.” Mar
garet Bryan then went to the shop of Mr Rentmore, in Cla-
rendon square, and brought back a phial about three parts
full of stuﬀ smelling like almonds. Deceased was then
lying on the sofa in the parlour, and appeared very cheer-
ful. Witness left him to get her breakfast, leaving the phial
and the wine on the table. She returned in about ﬁve
minutes ; and, on entering the room, asked deceased how
he was. He replied, he felt better, but his stomach began
to pain him ; at that moment he turned over on the sofa
and appeared fainting, and made a gurgling noise in the
throat. She called for water, and then sent for a doctor.
Mr Wakeﬁeld came, and said he was dead, and had taken
poison.—By the Coroner : I had never seen the deceased
before. I had not the slightest idea that he had sent for
poison, and I intended to have taken a portion of what he
sent for had he left any, as he said it was for low spirits.
I should say he was not more than twenty years of age.
When alive he appeared of rather sallow complexion, and
has dark-brown hair. His dress consists of a black frock
coat, black satin waistcoat, lavender-coloured striped trou-
sers with straps, the whole quite new, a blue striped silk
neckerchief, white stockings, yellow kid goves, and short
boots, a new hat, maker's name “ Townend, Cheapside and
Regent street.” He had with him a small yellow stick,
with the handle much bitten, and his linen was marked
“ G. Oldﬁeld, jun.” On his person were found two hand-
kerchiefs, one white muslin, with the name “ G. Oldﬁeld ”
on it, the other silk ; a cigar-case, a green purse studded
with steel beads and tassle, with 2s. in it, and on his ﬁnger
a gold ring with a green stone. Deceased did not give
witness any other money than for the wine and for the
stuﬀ. Margaret Bryan proved having gone with the pre-
scription ﬁrst to the shop of Mr Wakeﬁeld, and then to
that of Mr Rentmore, where she procured the stuﬀ for
deceased, and paid 1s. 9d. for it, and that she was served
by a young man, Mr Rentmore's brother. The witness
having identiﬁed the prescription, the deputy-coroner said
it was in Latin, and was “ half an ounce hydrocyanic acid,”
and at the bottom was written “ for ﬂavouring soups,” and
it was signed “ G. O.” Mr Wakeﬁeld proved that when
he was called to see deceased he was quite dead. The
deputy-coroner animadverted on any chemist selling so
large a quantity of poison to a stranger, and called upon
Mr Rentmore for an explanation. Mr Rentmore, jun.,
who served it, said he understood that the girl who fetched
the poison came from the pastrycook in Seymour street,
and knowing oil of almonds was used in that trade, he
served it. The deputy-coroner said the circumstances of
the case were so strange, although there was no reason to
believe that the witness Mayne had connived at the de-
ceased poisoning himself, that he felt it necessary to adjourn
the inquiry for further evidence, and to have the body
opened. The inquiry was ultimately adjourned till Mon-
day last, and after the post-mortem examination, the
body was removed to St Pancras workhouse for iden-
tiﬁcation.—On Monday the inquest was resumed. Mrs
Emily Oldﬁeld, the wife of Mr Oldﬁeld, rope-maker,
Southgate road, Balls pond, Islington, stated that the
deceased was her son, and that he was warehouse clerk
in the employ of Messrs Warwick and Sons, wholesale
druggists, Garlick hill. On the morning of the 2nd inst. he
left home for his oﬃce, and told witness that he would go
with some friends to Gravesend that day. She gave him
8s. 6d., but did not know what other money he had. She
never afterwards saw him alive. Her impression was, that
he had been drugged in the house in Aldenham street, and
then murdered. The coroner assured Mrs Oldﬁeld that
both he and the jury were fully convinced, by the evidence
given on the ﬁrst day, that her son had not been drugged.
On the contrary, they felt that the circumstance was unfor-
tunate for all parties, and that every attention had been
paid to him. Mr Rentmore, brother and assistant to Mr
Rentmore, surgeon, said that he sold to the servant of the
house in Aldenham street, half an ounce of the essential oil
of almonds in an ounce and a half bottle. He imagined that
it was required by a soap-maker or a pastry-cook. It was
usual with druggists to sell as much as an ounce of it to
persons in those trades. The bottle was not labelled. Mr
G. Wakeﬁeld, surgeon, examined the body, which gave
evidence of the destructive presence of prussic acid, which,
no doubt, was the cause of death. The quantity sold de-
ceased was suﬃcient to kill four persons. The jury, after
half an hour's deliberation, returned a verdict, “ That
George Oldﬁeld, jun., died by taking the essential oil of
almonds with his own hands, but that there was no evidenc�
of his state of mind at the time that he took it.” The jury
accompanied the verdict with a censure on Mr Rentmore,
jun., for having so incautiously sold the poison.</Unicode></TextEquiv></TextRegion>
