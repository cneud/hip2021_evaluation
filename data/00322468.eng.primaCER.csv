Five years ago, when Christian’s Pates de Lichen first 
came under our notice, we spoke favourably of their properties as 
a remedy for coughs, and all affections of the throat arising from

in this weather are almost as indispensable to the invalid as goloshes 
or a top coat. It is often remarked that every disease has its 
counteracting remedy, and in this case the axiom holds good ; for 
if the prevailing evil in Birmingham is a tendeucy to throat 
disease, the panacea, and it is a pleasant one, is parien in the 
Pate de Lichen,—Manufactured by steam in the laboratory of Mr. 
Christian, and sold at his Dispensing Establishment, New Street, 
corner of Cannon Street,) Birmingham.—Birmingham Daily Post.
