at Philadelphia in the early part of July, adopted an ad‑
dress to their fellow citizens of the United States, with a
declaration of principles which are essentially embodied
in the following resolutions :—
RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED JULY 5 AND 7, 1845.
Believing our free institutions, if worth anything, to
be worth preserving, and transmitting unimpaired.
Believing the permanency of those institutions to de‑
pend upon the honest and intelligent exercise of the right
of suﬀrage.
Believing that ruin, if it come, will come through a
perversion and abuse of that right.
Believing such perversion and abuse to have already
prevailed, and to be now increasing to an alarming ex‑
tent.
Believing that the greatest source of evil in this respect
is to be found in the rapid inﬂux of ignorant foreigners,
and the facility with which they are converted into
citizens.
Believing that Americans in form should, and of right
ought to be, Americans at heart.
Believing that under any circumstances it is dangerous
to commit the ballet box, the ark of our freedom's cove‑
nant, to foreign hands, or submit our destinies to the pos‑
sible control of them, who may be foreigners in heart,
and Americans in form only.
Believing that from any of the old political organiza‑
tions, as such we cannot hope for any radical reform of
the evils we deprecate.
Therefore, 1. Resolved, That we do hereby form our‑
selves into a national political party, for the radical re‑
form of abuses, and the preservation of our institutions
and our liberties, under the name of the Native Americans'

NATIVE AMERICANISM, 
The National Convention of Native Americans, held 
at Philadelphia in the early part of July, adopted an ad- 
dress to their fellow citizens of the United States, with a 
declaration of principles which are essentially embodied 
in the following resolutions :—

Believing the permanency of those institutions to de- 
pend upon the honest and intelligent exercise of the right 
of suffrage. 
Believing that ruin, if it come, will come through a 
perversion and abuse of that right. 
Believing such perversion and abuse to have already 
prevailed, and to be now increasing to an alarming ex- 
tent. 
Believing that the greatest source of evil in this respect 
is to be found in the rapid influx of ignorant foreigners, 
and the facility with which they are converted into 
citizens. 
Believing that Americans in form should, and of right 
ought to be, Americans at heart. 
Believing that under any circumstances it is dangerous 
to commit the ballet box, the ark of our freedom’s cove- 
nant, to foreign hands, or submit our destinies to the pos- 
sible control of them, who may be foreigners in heart, 
and Americans in form only. 
Believing that from any of the old political organiza- 
tions, as such we cannot hope for any radical reform of 
the evils we deprecate. j 
Therefore, 1. Resolved, That we do hereby form our- 
selves into a national political party, for the radical re- 
form of abuses, and the preservation of our institutions | 
and our liberties, under the name of the Native Americans’ | 
Party. 
2s ‘Bessel: That, as native Americans, we cannot con- 
sent to give our political suffrages to any other than to 
those born on our soil and matured among our institu- 
tions. 
3. Resolved, That no foreigner hereafter coming to 
these United States shall be allowed to exercise the elec-
