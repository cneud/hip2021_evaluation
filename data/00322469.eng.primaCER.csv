‘Police Office, Birmingham, February 16th, 1857.—Sir, Some 
time since the Chairman of the Watch Committee expressed a wish 
that the whole of the force should devote one day’s pay to the 
Crimean Fund. Provisions then being high, I could only, I deeply 
regret to say, carry out his views to about one-half of the extent. 
I have spoken to two of the senior Inspectors since, but at present 
I cannot make any progress, It is my decided wish to carry out 
the wish suggested. Oblige me by giving me your opinion how you 
would act, (in my situation,) either by letting it stop over for two 
or three months, as provisions are fast falling, or at once close it. 
Apologising for thus troubling you, I am, Sir, your very obedient 
servant, R, A, SreEPHENS.—Captain Fishbourne, 19, New Street, 
Spring Gardens, London.”
