to the politician and the journalist also—if they profess
allegiance to the name of Christ, and regard their work as
not alien to their profession‑special reﬂections and lessons
are suggested by the return of the day on which peace and
goodwill were ﬁrst proclaimed as the law of the world, and
a new spirit came over the civil and social, as well as over
the religious life of man. It is good for those who are
always engaged in party controversies and conﬂicts to banish
party feeling for a moment from the mind—to think of the
common end which all good men pursue, though by diﬀerent
roads—to look forward to the common haven in which all
who have loved and served their kind will one day meet as
friends for ever, and wonder that in the mist of earthly
strife they once took each other for enemies. Now, too,
when the Author of Christianity came into the world, a
homeless peasant, to minister to others, is the season to
remember that Christian polities is a code of duties, rather
than of rights. Now is the season to think how worthless
are all political advantages, how trivial are all political
disputes, compared with that which concerns the spiritual
life while we celebrate the advent of a Master who,
though he brought with him the truth that makes us free,
was content to pay tribute to a foreign despot and to die
the death of a slave. Now is the season for those whose
work must always be more or less embittered by faction
and contention, to lay aside faction and contention for a
moment, and enter in spirit into the great communion of
mankind.
This Christmas is, alas ! far from a “ Merry Christmas” to
many families, or to the whole nation. By many a hearth,
instead of the voice of joy and feasting, there is the voice of
mourning for aﬄiction the most poignant that can enter
into the heart of man. In many a house, a though of
unutterable anguish has taken the place of a beloved face.
Many a parent needs to be comforted by the reﬂection that
those who fell in duty are not cut oﬀ, but taken early home
Many a widow needs to be assured that aﬀection is not ended
but ratiﬁed by death. The nation, too, is engaged in what
must be regarded as a strange and alien work for a
