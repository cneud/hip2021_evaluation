The admirals will be put to bed at a i 
hour on a fixed night, pat from that Hada 
account will be kept of their rest and activit 
how long they lay in bed, how long they wine 
rising, what period at a stretch they were able to 
stand on their legs without or with the aid of 
stick or crutches, how many yards they could see 
without or with glasses, what sounds, and of what 
loudnegs, they could hear without or with ear 
trumpets. ‘here will be stairs as high as those of 
the companion stairs of a first-rate, and an exact 
record will be kept of the number of times a day 
if any, the admirals can mount them, and of the 
time occupied in each enterprise. 
There will also be a promenade the length of a 
first-rate’s quarter deck, and the number of turns 
the admirals respectively take, if any, and the time 
occupied, will be noted. 
A balance will then be struck of the different 
abilities and infirmities, just as with the points in 
which ships excel or fail. There are ships that 
sail ill and lie-to well, and there are admirals 
that do the same, and one will lie-to for a month 
or six weeks at a stretch without straining, head 
to pillow. 
In the log of the Experimental Hospital such 
entries as these will appear :— 
August 15th,—Signal made for admirals to get 
out of bed, dress, mount and walk the quarter 
deck, and exercise sight on the fore-top gallant 
sail. If an admiral in mounting the companion 
stairs has the misfortune to tumble, the order is, 
that upon that accident all shall return to their 
berths, and the sleeping order be resumed. On 
deck, if any admiral’s cocked hat be carried away 
by stress of weather, all dfe to be turned down 
below, for fear of fresh misadventure, and the 
experiments cease for that day, nightcaps being 
resumed. 
The Admiralty does not mean to insist that 
admirals shall be able to climb to the deck and 
walk it, or sit it, or stand it for that matter. It 
would, indeed, prefer such qualifications, if attain- 
able; but if not, and if there be the choice of anad- 
miral always in bed, and one who is sometimes out 
of it, the Admiralty will choose the latter. So for 
an experimental squadron it will not require that 
the admiral shall be able to see to the bowsprit 
end without or with glasses; but if it has the elec- 
tion of one who can see the fore-top while another 
can see only as far as the main-top, the Admiralty, 
ceteris paribus, will prefer the admiral with the 
superior organs of sight. The admirals in the 
Experimental Hospital will be allowed respectively 
the aid of four nurses each, to be divided into 
watches of the starboard and larboard nurses, and 
to relieve each other at the usual periods,
