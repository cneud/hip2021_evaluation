" The documents containing the correspondence on the
subject of the foreign edicts against our commerce, with
the instructions given to our Ministers at London and
Paris, are now laid before you.
"The Communication made to Congress at their last Ses‑
sion explained the posture in which the close of the discus‑
sion relative to the attack by a British ship of war on the
frigate Chesapeake, left a subject on which the nation had
manifested so honourable a sensibility. Every view of what
had passed authorized a belief that immediate steps would
be taken by the British Government for redressing a wrong,
which, the more it was investigated, appeared the more
clearly to require what had not been provided for in the
special mission. It is found that no steps have been taken
for the purpose. On the contrary, it will be seen in the
documents laid before you, that the inadmissible prelimi‑
nary which obstructs the adjustment is still adhered to ;
and, moreover, that it is now brought into connexion with
the distinct and irrelative case of the Orders in Council.
The instructions which had been given to our Ministers at
London, with a view to facilitate, if necessary, the repa‑
ration claimed by the United States, are included in the
documents communicated.
" Our relations with the other Powers of Europe
have undergone no material changes since your last Ses‑
sion. The important negociations with Spain, which had
been alternately suspended and resumed, necessarily expe‑
rience a pause, under the extraordinary and interesting
crisis which distinguish her internal situation.
" With the Barbary Powers we continue in harmony,
with the exception of an unjusstiﬁable proceeding of the
Dey of Algiers towards our Consul to that Regency. Its
character and circumstances are now laid before you, and
will enable you to decide how far it may, either now or
hereafter, call for any measures not within the limits of
the Executive Authority.
" With our Indian neighbours the public peace has
been steadily maintained. Some instances of individual
wrong have, as at other times, taken place, but in no
wise implicating the will of the nation. Beyond the Mis‑
sissippi, the Loways, the Saca, and the Alibamas, have
delivered up, for trial and punishment, individuals from
among themselves accused of murdering citizens of the
United States, on this side, the Mississippi ; the Creeks
are exerting themselves to arrest oﬀenders of the same
kind ; and the Choctaws have manifested their readiness
and desire for amicable and just arrangements, respect‑
ing depredations committed by disorderly persons of their
tribe. And generally, from a conviction that we consider
them as a part of ourselves, and cherish with sincerity
their rights and interests, the attachment of the Indian
tribes is gaining strength daily ; is extending from the
nearer to the more remote, and will amply requite us for
the justice and friendship practised towards them ; hus‑
