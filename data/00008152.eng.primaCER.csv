CORN MARKETS. 
(From Messrs Gillies and Horne’s Circular.) 
Conn Excuanee, Monpay, Sept. 8.—There was a short supply 
of Essex wheat this morning, the most of it of the new crop, the 
condition better than last week considerably, and the market was 
decidedly in favour of the seller. There was no change in barley; 
all the large consumers are waiting for the new crop. Oats are 6d. 
dearer than last Monday; Archangel were much forced on the 
market last Wednesday, which has brought buyers forward to-day. 
Beans are firm. Peas of all kinds are the same as last week. 
Flour is firm.

CORN MARKETS.
(From Messrs Gillies and Horne's Circular.)
CORN EXCHANGE, MONDAY, SEPT. 8.—There was a short supply
of Essex wheat this morning, the most of it of the new crop, the
condition better than last week considerably, and the market was
decidedly in favour of the seller. There was no change in barley ;
all the large consumers are waiting for the new crop. Oats are 6d.
dearer than last Monday ; Archangel were much forced on the
market last Wednesday, which has brought buyers forward to‑day.
Beans are ﬁrm. Peas of all kinds are the same as last week.
Flour is ﬁrm.

CORN EXCHANGE, FRIDAY, SEPT. 12.—Good old wheat is in
demand at 1s. over Monday's rates. Barley is about the same as
on Monday. Oats are 6d. dearer than on Monday, with a quick
demand. Beans are ﬁrm. White and blue peas are scarce, and a
shade dearer than on Monday. The ﬂour trade is not better than
on Monday.
Into London from September 7 to September 11, both inclusive.

of the crew were ineﬀectual. The deceased sunk and was
seen no more. No appearance of insanity was attached to
him, as far as those on board had opportunity of ascertain‑
ing during the voyage, but he was observed to be exceed‑
ingly low‑spirited and restless. On Friday night he partook
of tea with the rest of the passengers, and he sat in the cabin
all night. On Saturday morning he took breakfast alone.
At about two o'clock in the afternoon he had a small bottle
of porter and a biscuit, and after the other passengers had
dined, he dined by himself on deck, and soon after he had
ﬁnished his meal, he committed himself to the waves. He
was about 5 feet 8 inches high, had a round face, appeared
to be 30 or 31 years of age, and was dressed in a Taglioni
coat, light drab trousers, light waistcoat, light handkerchief,
and Wellington boots. According to the best of the recol‑
lection of Mr Barrow, the clerk of the William Darley, the
deceased had a watch in his pocket at the time he jumped
overboard. A certiﬁcate was handed to the Lord Mayor,
signed by the whole of the passengers, to the eﬀect that every
exertion was made by the captain to save the unfortunate
man. A passenger was booked as Mr H. Coll, Norwich,
who was supposed to be the gentleman who drowned him‑
self, as a box, with his name upon it, was left on board, and
had not been claimed. There was also a light leather port‑
manteau, a coat, and ﬁshing tackle, unclaimed. The de‑
ceased was said to have destroyed himself just as the other
passengers had all moved to the opposite side of the vessel
to look at the Gazelle steamer, which was rapidly passing
along.
REBECCA AGAIN.—In carrying out the provisions of the
late Act of Parliament relating to the Turnpike trusts in
South Wales, some of the gates in the neighbourhood of
Brecon have already been removed, the tolls reduced, and
the distances between other gates are about being equalized.
Among the latter the turnpike‑gate near the ninth mile‑
stone on the Merthyr road is to be removed, and a new
toll‑house erected this side of the Storys Arms. This build‑
ing was last week in course of erection, and in a few
days expected to be ﬁnished, but on Monday morning last,
upon the workmen going to their work, the new toll‑
house had disappeared, and the men were struck with
astonishment at the industry displayed by the parties who
had in so short a period levelled their work.—' Hereford

dined, he dined by himself on deck, and soon after he had 
finished his meal, he committed himself to the waves.

deceased had a watch in his pocket at the time he jumped 
overboard. A certificate was handed to the Lord Mayor, 
signed by the whole of the passengers, to the effect that every 
exertion was made by the captain to save the unfortunate

to look at the Gazelle steamer, which was rapidly passing 
along.
