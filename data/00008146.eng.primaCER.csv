and on the following morning the Royal yacht anchored 
the pressing invitation of Louis Phili isit hi 
passant at the Chateau of Eu. pee ey Sen a 
At eight o’clock the King and Queen of ; 
the Princess Adelaide, and all the members one 
family, arrived at Tréport in the grand char-a-bane a 
lowed by eight or ten other carriages. The King looked 
better than he has done for six months. Half an hour 
afterwards the British steamer, with the Royal standard 
of England displayed, was within a mile of the shore, 
King Louis Philippe immediately entered a barge, with a 
few attendants, and proceeded to the ‘ Courrier’ steamer, 
in which he approached the ‘ Victoria and Albert.’ From 
the ‘Courrier’ his Majesty descended into a boat fully 
manned, and pulled to the ‘ Victoria and Albert.” Some 
little bustle took place, and then the Royal party de« 
scended into the barge, in which they were rowed towards 
the shore. In consequence, however, of its being nearly 
low water the barge could not land, and as the strand was 
distant from the road, a curious but simple expedient to 
obviate the difficulty suggested itself to the King. His 
Majesty ordered the horse to be attached to one of the 
numerous large bathing machines on the strand, and by 
aid of it the Queen was enabled to reach the shore, a 
mode of travelling which very much amused the illustri- 
ous visitor. Planks having been laid down on the beach 
for the use of the Royal party, the Queen advanced to 
meet Queen Victoria, whom she greeted most cordially, 
and embraced several times. Her Majesty also kissed 
Prince Albert on both cheeks, The Queen of the French 
then presented the Princess of Salerno and the Sicilian 
Princesses to her Majesty, after which the whole party 
got into char-a-bancs, the Queen sitting next to Louis 
Philippe, and Prince Albert next to the Queen of the 
French, and proceeded to the Chateau d’Eu, amidst the 
cordial applause of the assembled crowds. On the arrival 
of the Royal party at the chateau, a splendid dejeuner 
was served up, which was attended by all the visitors at 
the chateau. After the dejeuner Louis Philippe took 
the opportunity of introducing the Queen to the new Vic- 
toria Gallery—a splendid gallery, intended to commemo- 
rate her Majesty’s first visit to the Chateau d’Eu, and 
which is decorated with views of the principal scenes of 
that occasion, painted by some of the first painters in 
France. This very handsome compliment to his guest 
was not thrown away. Her Majesty felt greatly gratified. 
In the afternoon the Royal party drove into the forest, 
and in the evening there was a splendid dinner at the 
chateau, which was attended by all the civil and military 
authorities of the place, as well as by the guests resident 
at the chateau. In the evening the Royal party attended 
a theatrical entertainment in the chateau, the performers 
of the Opera Comique having been sent for from Paris for 
the occasion. The performances were the ‘ Beau Seig- 
neur’ and ‘Richard Coeur de Lion.’ 
On Tuesday morning the Royal party again drove in 
the forest in char-a-bancs, and returned to the chateau at 
half-past one. The Queen and Prince Albert afterwards 
walked in the ground attached tothe palace. Shortly be- 
fore six in the evening her Majesty and the Prince, ac- 
companied by the King and Queen of the French, left the 
Chateau d’Eu for Tréport. A body of troops were sta- 
tioned in the quadrangle of the palace, and a consider- 
able crowd had gathered within its precincts. The vehi- 
cles used were the same as those for the forenoon ride. 
As they passed out the band played the English national 
anthem, and the crowd shouted “ Vive le Roi des Fran- 
gais et la Reine d’Angletaire.” At six o’clock the corlége 
arrived at the landing-place, the bells of the church ring- 
ing merrily, and a distant battery of cannon firing a 
salute. The embarkation was speedily accomplished ; 
Louis Philippe handed the Queen on board, and the next 
moment the party was gliding rapidly seaward. Queen 
Victoria was the only lady on board the barge; close to 
her sat the King of the French, Prince de Joinville, and 
Prince Albert; Lord Aberdeen, M. Guizot, and Lord 
Liverpool, completed the party. The other members of 
the suite went in other boats. As the Royal barge shot 
past there was a tremendous rush along the jetty: the 
steamers in the offing manned their yards, and the sea- 
ward batteries fired double royal salutes. At half-past six 
o'clock the Royal party were safely on board the ‘ Vic- 
toria and Albert,’ and under weigh for England. The 
voyage across the Channel was prosperously performed— 
the weather continuing serene and the sea smooth, 
On Wednesday afternoon a telegraphic despatch from 
Portsmouth announced the safe arrival of her Majesty at

of England displayed, was within a mile of the shore.
King Louis Philippe immediately entered a barge, with a
few attendants, and proceeded to the ' Courrier' steamer,
in which he approached the ' Victoria and Albert.' From
the ' Courrier' his Majesty descended into a boat fully
manned, and pulled to the ' Victoria and Albert.' Some
little bustle took place, and then the Royal party de-
scended into the barge, in which they were rowed towards
the shore. In consequence, however, of its being nearly
low water the barge could not land, and as the strand was
distant from the road, a curious but simple expedient to
obviate the diﬃculty suggested itself to the King. His
Majesty ordered the horse to be attached to one of the
numerous large bathing machines on the strand, and by
aid of it the Queen was enabled to reach the shore, a
mode of travelling which very much amused the illustri-
ous visitor. Planks having been laid down on the beach
for the use of the Royal party, the Queen advanced to
meet Queen Victoria, whom she greeted most cordially,
and embraced several times. Her Majesty also kissed
Prince Albert on both cheeks. The Queen of the French
then presented the Princess of Salerno and the Sicilian
Princesses to her Majesty, after which the whole party
got into char-a-bancs, the Queen sitting next to Louis
Philippe, and Prince Albert next to the Queen of the
French, and proceeded to the Chateau d'Eu, amidst the
cordial applause of the assembled crowds. On the arrival
of the Royal party at the chateau, a splendid dejeuner
was served up, which was attended by all the visitors at
the chateau. After the dejeuner Louis Philippe took
the opportunity of introducing the Queen to the new Vic-
toria Gallery—a splendid gallery, intended to commemo-
rate her Majesty's ﬁrst visit to the Chateau d'Eu, and
which is decorated with views of the principal scenes of
that occasion, painted by some of the ﬁrst painters in
France. This very handsome compliment to his guest
was not thrown away. Her Majesty felt greatly gratiﬁed.
In the afternoon the Royal party drove into the forest,
and in the evening there was a splendid dinner at the
chateau, which was attended by all the civil and military
authorities of the place, as well as by the guests resident
at the chateau. In the evening the Royal party attended
a theatrical entertainment in the chateau, the performers
of the Opera Comique having been sent for from Paris for
the occasion. The performances were the ' Beau Seig-
neur' and ' Richard Cœur de Lion.'
On Tuesday morning the Royal party again drove in
the forest in char-a-bancs, and returned to the chateau at
half-past one. The Queen and Prince Albert afterwards
walked in the ground attached to the palace. Shortly be-
fore six in the evening her Majesty and the Prince, ac-
companied by the King and Queen of the French, left the
Chateau d'Eu for Tréport. A body of troops were sta-
tioned in the quadrangle of the palace, and a consider-
able crowd had gathered within its precincts. The vehi-
cles used were the same as those for the forenoon ride.
As they passed out the band played the English national
anthem, and the crowd shouted “ Vive le Roi des Fran-
çais et la Reine d'Angletaire.” At six o'clock the cortège
arrived at the landing-place, the bells of the church ring-
ing merrily, and a distant battery of cannon ﬁring a
salute. The embarkation was speedily accomplished ;
Louis Philippe handed the Queen on board, and the next
moment the party was gliding rapidly seaward. Queen
Victoria was the only lady on board the barge ; close to
her sat the King of the French, Prince de Joinville, and
Prince Albert ; Lord Aberdeen, M. Guizot, and Lord
Liverpool, completed the party. The other members of
the suite went in other boats. As the Royal barge shot
past there was a tremendous rush along the jetty : the
steamers in the oﬃng manned their yards, and the sea-
ward batteries ﬁred double royal salutes. At half-past six
o'clock the Royal party were safely on board the ' Vic-
toria and Albert,' and under weigh for England. The
voyage across the Channel was prosperously performed—
the weather continuing serene and the sea smooth.
On Wednesday afternoon a telegraphic despatch from
Portsmouth announced the safe arrival of her Majesty at
Osborne house, in the Isle of Wight, after an absence
from England of thirty-three days.
The preparations that have been made for the reception
of the Queen and the Infanta of Spain and their Royal
guests, the Duke and Duchess de Nemours and the Duke
d'Aumale, are all on a scale of great splendour. Bull-ﬁghting
forms, of course, the principal feature of the amusements.
The following is the programme of the festivities preparing
by the loyal Narvarese for their Sovereign and her guests :
—“ The Queen our Lady having deigned to select this ca-
pital in order to receive, in company with her august mother
and sister, their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess
de Nemours and the Duke d'Aumale on the 4th of Septem-
ber next, and the municipality being desirous of celebrating
in the most becoming manner so joyful an event, has pre-
pared two bull-ﬁghts, the combatants at which will be the
celebrated Montes and his troop, another of novillos (young
bulls) which will be encountered with lances and darts, and
slain by the youthful amateurs of this city ; various com-
pârsas and dances, splendid illuminations and ﬁreworks
prepared by eminent artists, and various other amusements.
All these festivities, which will probably take place on the
4th. and following days, await the good pleasure of her Ma-
jesty ; their positive fulﬁlment will be made known to the
public at the earliest possible moment. At each of the two
bull-ﬁghts six bulls will be attacked with long lances and
darts, and slain, besides one by the journeyman millers, ac-
cording to ancient custom. The bulls will be selected from
herds natives of the country. During the ﬁght several bulls
will be attacked with the cloak (se capearan) by the espada
Montes, so justly celebrated for his skill in every mode o
