MISS BRADBURY.—It will be seen, by an advertisement in
another column, that this young lady's Concert takes place
tomorrow evening. The selection comprises some very
beautiful compositions, and altogether the performance
promises to be of a highly popular character. We feel
convinced that Miss B. will not fail, on this occasion, to
receive the support to which her talents and laudable anxiety
to please at all times, so amply entitle her.
Mr. Calvert, of the Hull Theatre, we observe, has notiﬁed
his intention of delivering a course of Lectures on Elocution,
at the Exchange Room, to commence on the 12th instant.
The Literary and Philosophical Society have evinced the
estimation in which they hold the talent of Mr. C. by giving
their sanction to the undertaking ; we feel assured, under
these circumstances, that the success of this gentleman, upon
the occasion in question, will be fully adequate to the
opinion so generally entertained of his ability.

MASQUERADE.—The first of these entertainments this season 
was celebrated on Thursday night, at the Argyll Rooms, 
under the direction of the celebrated Charles Wright. The 
name of that indefatigable purveyor of Champagne is so iden- 
tified with all masquerades in the metropolis, that it is diffi- 
cult to separate them and it, even in idea, His name needs 
only to be announced to attract all the lovers of fun, The 
rooms were well filled, and the various natives of fire, of air, 
of earth, of water, displayed themselves for the amusement of 
their friends and of themselves ; good humour and Wright's 
Sparkling were the main objects of attention. It has some- 
times happened that the frequenters of these motley scenes 
have deemed laughter injurious to their health, if we might 
Judge by their extreme abstinence from it. But the merry 
guests of Thursday evening seemed very gluttons in that 
amusement, and did not trouble themselves about what 
crabbed critics might think. If they did only sometimes 
please, at least they always had the desire to do 80; and those 
present generally gave them credit for the former, through 
the merits of the latter. We will here conclude by obser ving 
that Charles Wright has, with this masquerade, added a new 
claim to the many he already possesses on public favour,
